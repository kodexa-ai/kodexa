title: What is Kodexa?
---


Kodexa is a platform for building intelligent document processing pipelines. It is a set of tools and services that
allow you to build a pipeline that can take a document, extract the content, and then process it to extract the
information you need.

It is built on a set of core principles:

* **Document Centric** - Kodexa is built around the idea of a document. A document is a collection of content
  nodes that are connected together. This is a powerful model that allows you to build pipelines that can
  extract content from a wide range of sources.

* **Pipeline Oriented** - Kodexa is built around the idea of a pipeline. A pipeline is a series of steps that
  can be executed on a document. This allows you to build a pipeline that can extract content from a wide range
  of sources.

* **Extensible** - Kodexa is built around the idea of a pipeline. A pipeline is a series of steps that can be executed
  on a document. This allows you to build a pipeline that can extract content from a wide range of sources.

* **Label Driven** - Kodexa focuses on the idea of labels. Labels are a way to identify content within a document
  and then use that content to drive the processing of the document.
