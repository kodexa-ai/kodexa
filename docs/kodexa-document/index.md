# What is a Kodexa Document

## I. Purpose

The purpose of a Kodexa document is to represent unstructured data as a **generalized structured document** that can *
*support a wide variety of use cases**. The underlying idea is that given unstructured data, how do we introduce
structure to better access its contents and **standardize how we work with documents**.

This resulting Kodexa document object can then be accessed using a common API, and users can make use of the object's
methods to extract the content they need. By storing data in this manner, we can structure content in such a way that it
is **flexible** while also **allowing for the addition of features** to describe the contents further.

## II. Structure

Now, we can start discussing the structure of a Kodexa document. A Kodexa document is a **hierarchical tree like
structure** **composed of content nodes**. These content nodes can be one of a variety of types, such as:

- **Root Nodes**
    - These nodes are used to reference the document in its entirety. All nodes in a Kodexa document can be traced back
      to its root node.
- **Page Nodes**
    - Page nodes are used to reference specific pages in a document.
- **Content Area Nodes**
    - Content area nodes are used to reference blocks of content within a specific page. These content areas can be
      blocks of text or images.
- **Line Nodes**
    - Inside a specific content area, line nodes are used to reference specific lines in a block of text.
- **Word Nodes**
    - Word nodes are the leaf nodes of our document tree. These nodes contain the actual content of our document.

Each content node consists of the following:

1. **Content Parts**:
    - Contains the actual content. This content is usually a string or an encoded image. Usually, **only the leaf nodes
      ** of the tree **contain the actual content parts** in a Kodexa document.
2. **Content Features**:
    - These content features are used to **describe or add information about a specific content node**.
    - Content features can also be described by their **type**. Some examples of these types are spatial features like
      bounding boxes and text features like font.

## III. A Simple Kodexa Document

To help you better understand and visualize what has been discussed so far, here is an example of a simple PDF and its
corresponding Kodexa document. The step-by-step process for converting the PDF into a Kodexa document is also described
below

1. To start, a root node is used to reference our simple PDF as a whole.
2. Next, we can add a page node that references our page.
3. After which, we would need a content area node to reference where the content is in our document. This content area
   node has a spatial content feature, bounding box, to help users see where this specific content area is on the page.
4. Next, we can create a line which can be used to reference each line in a content area. Since our content area has two
   lines, weâ€™ll need to create two line nodes.
5. Lastly, we can create word nodes for each of our line nodes to reference each of the words in a line.

Our final Kodexa document tree can also be visualized by layering its data on top of our initial PDF
